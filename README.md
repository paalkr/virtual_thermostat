_Component based upon the virtual thermostat project (https://github.com/dadge/virtual_thermostat)._

This custom component for Home Assistant solves a very specific use case, and you will probably not need this.
Some hardware thermostats come without presets. This component creates a virtual thermostat with presets and will
execute a continuous two-way sync of status and setpoint between the hardware thermostat and the virtual thermostat.

## How Generic thermostat behaves with modes :
Basically, the generic thermostat handle two preset mode : AWAY and NONE.
When AWAY mode is set, the thermostat will set the tempaerature with the away temperature defined in the yaml configuration.
When NONE is selected, the temperature set is saved. Every time you set the mode as NONE, the temperature will be automatically set with the saved value. If you want to change the saved value, set the mode to NONE, set the deisred temperature, and that's it.

## How Virtual Thermostat behaves with modes and additional feature
Define by default all the modes defined in the climate specs : https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/climate#presets
The virtual thermostat reproduce the behavior of the mode NONE in generic thermostat and extend it to all the modes :
* Pick a mode

* Set a temperature

* That's it ! The temperature is saved for this mode.
* Reproduce the previous step to update the temperatures / set other modes


## Minimum requirements

* This implementstion can override or superseed the core generic thermostat

## Installation

### HACS installation

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). That way you get updates automatically.
2. Add this Github repository as custom repository in HACS settings.
3. search and install "Virtual Thermostat" in HACS and click `install`.
4. Modify your `configuration.yaml` as explain below.
5. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `virtual_thermostat`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/virtual_thermostat/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Modify your `configuration.yaml` as explain below
7. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

In the following examples we are assuming that you know how to configure a generic thermostat (if not please have a look at : https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/generic_thermostat/ ) and we will just highlight the differences in the configuration to apply.

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: virtual_thermostat
    name: Study
    heater: switch.study_heater
    target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature
```

If you had already configure a generic thermostat the onli changes you have to do are the following :
* platform must be changed from generic_thermostat to virtual_thermostat
* away_temp must be removed

## Even Better with Scheduler Component !

In order to enjoy the full power of virtual thermostat, I invite you to use it with https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-component
Indeed, the schdeuler component porpose a management of the climate base on the preset modes. This feature has limited interest with the generic thermostat but it becomes highly powerfull with Virtual thermostat :

Starting here, I assume you have installed Virtual Thermostat and Scheduler Component.

In Scheduler, add a schedule :

Choose "climate" group, choose one (or multiple) entity/ies, select "MAKE SCHEME" and click next :
(it is possible to choose "SET PRESET", but I prefer to use "MAKE SCHEME")

Set your mode scheme and save :

In this example I set ECO mode during the night and the day when nobody's at home BOOST in the morning and COMFORT in the evening.


I hope this example helps you, don't hesitate to give me your feedbacks !
